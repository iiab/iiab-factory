# To install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) 7.1 / pre-release onto Raspbian Buster,
# Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10, run this 1-line installer:
#
#                 curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash

# 1. WARNING: NOOBS IS *NOT* SUPPORTED, as its partitioning is very different.
#    On a Raspberry Pi, you need to INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF RASPBIAN:
#    https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md
#    To attempt IIAB 7.1 on another Linux see the full/manual instructions:
#    https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch

# 2. An Ethernet cable is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED during installation, as this is
#    more reliable than Wi-Fi (and faster!)  But if you must install IIAB using
#    Wi-Fi not Ethernet, remember to run 'iiab-hotspot-on' AT THE VERY END, TO
#    ACTIVATE RPi's INTERNAL WI-FI HOTSPOT, as this kills Internet over Wi-Fi!

# 3. Run 'sudo raspi-config' on RPi, to set LOCALISATION OPTIONS

# 4. OPTIONAL: if you have slow/pricey Internet, pre-position KA Lite's
#    mandatory 0.9 GB English Pack (en.zip) within /tmp -- you can grab a copy
#    from http://pantry.learningequality.org/downloads/ka-lite/0.17/content/contentpacks/en.zip

# 5. WHEN YOU RUN 1-LINE INSTALLER 'curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash'
#    YOU THEN NEED TO TYPE IN YOUR PASSWORD IF ON UBUNTU/DEBIAN/ETC (for sudo)
#    ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^

# 6. Follow on-screen instructions (TYPE 'sudo iiab' TO RESUME IF EVER NECESS!)

# 7. About 1-2 hours later, it will announce that INTERNET-IN-A-BOX (IIAB)
#    SOFTWARE INSTALL IS COMPLETE, prompting you to reboot...TO ADD CONTENT!
