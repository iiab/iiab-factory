WARNING: THE NOOBS OS IS *NOT* SUPPORTED, as its partitioning is very different.  On a Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">WE RECOMMEND YOU INSTALL THE LATEST RASPBERRY PI OS</a>.  To attempt IIAB 7.2 on <a href=https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms#operating-systems>another Linux</a>, see the <a href="https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch">full/manual instructions</a>.
<p>
An Ethernet cable is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED during installation, as this is more reliable than Wi-Fi (and faster too!)  WARNING: IF YOU CONNECT YOUR IIAB'S INTERNAL WIFI TO THE INTERNET OVER 5 GHz, YOU'LL PREVENT OLDER LAPTOPS/PHONES/TABLETS (WHICH REQUIRE 2.4 GHz) FROM CONNECTING TO YOUR IIAB'S INTERNAL HOTSPOT.  See: "wifi_up_down: True" in <a href=http://FAQ.IIAB.IO#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F>/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml</a> <!--  If however you must install over Wi-Fi, remember to run "iiab-hotspot-on" after IIAB installation, TO ACTIVATE YOUR RASPBERRY PI's INTERNAL WIFI HOTSPOT (thereby killing Internet connectivity!)-->
