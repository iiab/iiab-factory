Need to turn off the hibernate function of windows 10, so that ntfs-3g driver can read and write. Otherwise the partition is marked cloaked, and now writeable.

$ sudo mount /media/windows
Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.
Failed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operação não permitida
The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown
Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume
read-only with the 'ro' mount option.
