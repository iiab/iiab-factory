# To Create a OSM Subset:
* Visit [ http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=2/17.6/-78.8] this page and click the export button top row, middle left.
* Drag the handles at the corners of the bounding box to contain the area where increased detail is desired.
* Record the North, South, East, and West boundaries of the box.
* Copy central-america.ini to a filename that describes your subset. It is convenient to do this in the same directory which contains the scripts you will use:
   #. mk-subset.py
   #. cp-subset
   #. iiab-unzip
